## Achievements:

To meet the expectations of the customer, I structured the site to make it **readable, accessible and engaging**. The objective is to **highlight the brand Toy Surfboards and the expertise of Didier DAMESTOY**, to include the entire catalog in order to allow the customer to **navigate quickly on the site** and choose his custom surfboard adapted to **his desires and abilities**. I also accompanied Toy Surfboards in the development of an **Instagram Shop**.

**All the pages of the site meet the standards and recommendations of websites:**

- Both in terms of SEO
- Adaptable on different supports (mobile, tablet, computer)
- In overall performance
- In security
